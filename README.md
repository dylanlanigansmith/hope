#### ImGui x SDL3 Renderer x Emscripten
Currently a port of SDL3 ImGui Impl Demo to Emscripten w/ rough mobile keyboard support (tested on iOS)
Not sure what this will be yet but it is a good base

WASM is cooler than I expected.

Things we know about what this is:
    - Ditching the early stages of writing this to build locally as like a native app 
        - not that bad to do later
        - web is cool
    - maybe a game
